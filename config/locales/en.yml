    tweet:
      title: Tweet with Timesy
      body: You can use it for brainstorming ideas for technical blogs, as a log for personal development, and of course, you can tweet about everyday life. Because it's Markdown, you have a wider range of expressions than usual SNS.
    reaction:
      title: React with Timesy
      body: Let's send reactions to things that were beneficial or interesting. It's good to casually react with emojis, and it's also good to comment in detail with Markdown.
    contribution:
      title: Contribute to Timesy
      body: Timesy is OSS (Open Source Software). We want to reflect everyone's thoughts in the product, so please feel free to contribute.
